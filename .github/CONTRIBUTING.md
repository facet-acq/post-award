# Contributing

## Thank you

First off, let me sincerely thank you for being interested in contributing to this project. I started FACET-Acq for a single purpose, to provide high quality open source solutions to common business problems. Your interest in contributing shows how powerful this concept can be. By contributing to open source projects, in any capacity, is a fantastic and tangible step toward making the business environment a better place.

## Resources

- **Issues** we use [native GitHub issues](https://github.com/facet-acq/post-award/issues) to track project activities
- **Project Management** since ZenHub has such a tight integration with GitHub has does excellent support for Open Source projects, you can [see our ZenHub board](https://github.com/facet-acq/post-award/issues#boards?repos=107730020) here.
- **Chat** for the moment, GitHub issue comments should suffice. If need arises, I'm happy to go to Slack, Gitter or IRC as needed.
- **Road Map** check out the [FACET-Acq organization design repository](https://github.com/facet-acq/design) for a good idea of the goals of this program. There's also some [initial notes](https://github.com/facet-acq/design/blob/master/post_award.md) that show where post-award itself is going.

## Ways to contribute

All contributions are welcome! Please open an issue to discuss if you're not sure where to jump in.

### Business Intent/Product Management

While I can draw on my past experience in these processes and openly available research, my background  heavily leverages accounting, process and software engineering and system integration so if you're interested in helping to clarify (groom) of intent and business value and needs, you are most welcome! Entitlement, acquisitions, finance, contract management or program management experience are all welcome.
